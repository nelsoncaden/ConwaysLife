# ConwaysLife
Conway's game of life is a cellular automaton (an evolving grid of cell states) with a few simples rules. In short, if two or three neighboring cells are alive, a cell will stay alive, if three neighboring cells are alive, a dead cell will begin to live, and, finally, all other cells will remain or become dead.
